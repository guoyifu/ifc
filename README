IFC (Iris Foundation Classes) is a class library for C++ programming under
VC2005/VC2008/VC2010. It reimplemented many Delphi VCL classes and utility
routines on VC++, therefore it is particularly suitable for VC++ developers
who are also familiar with Delphi. 

IFC is an open source project. Please see:
