IFC (Iris Foundation Classes) is a Delphi-like class library for MFC/ATL/WTL 
programming under VC2005/VC2008/VC2010. It reimplemented many Delphi VCL classes 
and utility routines on VC++, therefore it is particularly suitable for VC++ 
developers who are also familiar with Delphi. 

IFC is an open source project. Please see:
